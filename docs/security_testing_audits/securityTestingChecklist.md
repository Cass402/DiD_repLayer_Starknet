### 16.3 Common Vulnerability Patterns

#### 16.3.1 Cairo-Specific Vulnerability Patterns

| Vulnerability             | Testing Pattern                                   | Example                                                                                    |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Felt252 Overflow          | Test arithmetic with boundary values              | `let a: felt252 = 2^251 - 1; let b: felt252 = 10; let c = a + b;`                          |
| Uninitialized Storage     | Check storage initialization patterns             | `struct PointState { x: felt252, y: felt252 }; // Missing initialization in constructor`   |
| Improper Storage Pattern  | Examine LegacyMap vs StorageMap usage             | `#[storage] struct Storage { data: LegacyMap<felt252, felt252> } // Unbounded growth risk` |
| Cross-Contract Reentrancy | Look for external calls followed by state changes | `external_contract.call(); self.balance -= amount;`                                        |
| Cairo Syscall Misuse      | Check for unsafe syscall usage                    | `unsafe_call_to_l1()` without proper validation                                            |
| Hash Domain Collision     | Test for missing context in hash input            | `poseidon_hash(message)` without domain prefix                                             |

#### 16.3.2 StarkNet-Specific Vulnerability Patterns

| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| L1-L2 Message Replay         | Check for missing nonce verification | Missing sequence number validation in message handlers           |
| StarkNet Fee Model Abuse     | Test fee estimation and payment      | Incorrect fee calculation leading to transaction failures        |
| Proxy Implementation Issues  | Verify proxy pattern implementation  | Storage layout collisions between proxy and implementation       |
| StarkNet Event Manipulation  | Check event emission integrity       | Missing or incomplete event emissions for critical state changes |
| StarkNet Version Mismatch    | Test compatibility across versions   | Using features not available in the deployed StarkNet version    |
| Cairo VM Resource Exhaustion | Test resource-intensive operations   | Unbounded loops or recursive operations without resource checks  |

#### 16.3.3 Bridge Vulnerability Patterns

| Vulnerability               | Testing Pattern                          | Example                                                |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Light Client Spoofing       | Test consensus verification              | Malicious block headers accepted by light client       |
| BGP Hijacking Vulnerability | Test resistance to network-level attacks | DNS server compromise leading to validator redirection |
| Message Replay              | Check for message uniqueness enforcement | Missing nonce or identifier for cross-chain messages   |
| Validator Collusion         | Test threshold security                  | 11/15 multisig where 11 validators could collude       |
| Chain Reorganization        | Test behavior during chain reorgs        | Bridge accepting messages before sufficient finality   |
| Finality Gadget Time Warp   | Test timing attack resistance            | Manipulating timestamp to bypass time-based controls   |

| Cross-Border Transfer Violation  | Test data localization compliance        | Transferring personal data without proper safeguards      |
| Erasure Timing Failure           | Test right to be forgotten response time | Erasure process taking longer than regulatory requirement |
| Consent Withdrawal Failure       | Test ability to withdraw consent         | Inability to revoke previously given consent              |
