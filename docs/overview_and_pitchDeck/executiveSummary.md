## 1. STRATEGIC OVERVIEW

Veridis delivers enterprise-grade decentralized identity and reputation infrastructure for StarkNet and the broader Web3 ecosystem. Our platform addresses two mission-critical challenges that have collectively cost the blockchain industry an estimated $3.8B annually:

- **Sybil Attack Vulnerability**: Exploitation by coordinated bot networks has compromised token distributions and governance, with documented 85-95% post-airdrop abandonment rates across recent L2 launches
- **Regulatory Compliance Gap**: Emerging global regulations (FATF Travel Rule, MiCA, SEC guidelines) mandate KYC/AML while users demand privacy and decentralization

Veridis resolves this fundamental tension through advanced cryptographic architecture, creating a trust layer that authenticates unique humans while preserving privacy and autonomy.

## 2. SOLUTION ARCHITECTURE

Our comprehensive identity framework leverages StarkNet's advanced capabilities through a four-component system:

### Core Protocol Components

| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Identity Registry**                 | Manages non-transferable identity NFTs functioning as digital passports   | Cairo smart contracts with ERC-721 extensions and account abstraction    |
| **Dual-Tier Attestation System**      | Separates high-trust credentials from experimental community badges       | Hierarchical attestation registry with differentiated verification paths |
| **Zero-Knowledge Verification Layer** | Enables selective disclosure of identity attributes without exposing data | StarkNet-optimized ZK circuits with nullifier protection                 |
