## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose and Scope

This document specifies the comprehensive requirements for the Veridis protocol, a privacy-preserving identity and attestation system built on StarkNet. It defines the functional, security, privacy, performance, and compliance requirements that must be satisfied by the protocol implementation.

The requirements outlined in this document serve as the foundation for the development, testing, and evaluation of the Veridis protocol. They establish measurable criteria for project success and guide technical decision-making throughout the development lifecycle.

### 1.2 Project Overview

Veridis is a privacy-preserving identity and attestation protocol that enables:

1. **Verifiable Credentials**: Cryptographically verifiable attestations about user attributes
2. **Zero-Knowledge Verification**: Privacy-preserving verification of credentials without revealing underlying data
3. **Cross-Chain Identity**: Consistent identity and attestation verification across multiple blockchains
4. **Sybil Resistance**: Protection against identity duplication while preserving privacy
5. **Selective Disclosure**: User control over what information is shared and with whom

The protocol is designed for deployment on StarkNet with cross-chain bridges to other ecosystems including Ethereum, Cosmos, Solana, and Polkadot.

### 1.3 Stakeholders

Key stakeholders for the Veridis protocol include:

1. **End Users**: Individuals who obtain and use credentials for verification
2. **Attesters**: Entities that issue verifiable credentials (KYC providers, identity verifiers, etc.)
3. **Verifiers**: Applications and services that verify user credentials
4. **Developers**: Teams building applications that integrate with Veridis
5. **Protocol Governance**: Entities responsible for protocol upgrades and parameter settings
6. **Auditors**: Security professionals evaluating the protocol's safety and compliance

### 1.4 Document Conventions

This requirements document uses the following conventions:

- **SHALL**: Indicates a mandatory requirement
- **SHOULD**: Indicates a recommended requirement
- **MAY**: Indicates an optional requirement
- **Priority Levels**:
  - **P0**: Critical - Must be implemented for initial release
  - **P1**: High - Required for production-ready release
  - **P2**: Medium - Important but can be implemented post-initial release
  - **P3**: Low - Desirable features for future enhancement
